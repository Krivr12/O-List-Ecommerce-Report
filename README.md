# AWS E-Commerce Data Analysis

This project analyzes the **Olist E-Commerce dataset** using **AWS Athena**, **Amazon S3**, and **Python** (PyAthena & Pandas).  
The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze customer and order data, then generate useful KPIs for insights.

---

## Features

- Load and clean raw Olist datasets.
- Query datasets using **AWS Athena** with SQL.
- Filter orders (e.g., by date range `2017-01-01` â†’ `2018-09-01`).
- Save **processed CSVs** for analysis.
- Upload both raw and processed datasets to **Amazon S3**.
- Jupyter notebooks for:
  - **Business Performance** (revenue, orders, customer growth).
  - **Operational Analysis** (delivery performance, order status).
- Dashboard app for visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- AWS Account with **S3** & **Athena** enabled
